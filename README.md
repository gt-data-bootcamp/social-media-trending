#  Data Science Bootcamp | Social Media Trending

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We are going to take look at social media trends to compare common hashtags and keywords.

### Project Proposal 
 * Before you start writing any code, remember that you only have one week to complete this project. View this project as a typical assignment from work. Imagine a bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production data base.

 * Take advantage of your Instructor and TA support during office hours and class project work time. They are a valuable resource and can help you stay on track.


### Data Cleanup & Analysis 
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

 * The sources of data that you will extract from.

 * The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

 * The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

 * The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
